:purpose: {

    -basic
        * an Arduino-based clock synchronized with GPS clocks and 
        provides an extensive customization base
        * all other atomic clocks are lame and I need to build one
        myself
        * who doesn't want another clock solely displaying UTC time
        with 7-segment digits?

    -advanced
        * platform to extend the GPS aspect beyond a simple clock
        * geotagging photos, geocaching, a LOT of uses for this
        "clock" platform

:build notes: {
    
    -pin connections (unit -> arduino uno)

        *7-segment serial display
            VCC -> 5V
            GND -> GND
            RX -> Pin 1

        *Serial enabled 16x2 LCD display
            VDD -> 5V
            GND -> GND
            RX -> Pin 4 

        *GPS
            Pin 1 -> 3V
            Pin 3 -> Pin 0
            Pin 5 -> GND

        //5V will have to be split off from the pin
        //If current exceeds USB current limit, a DC power
        //supply will supplement
